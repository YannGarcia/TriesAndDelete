# TriesAndDelete

Working repository for Q&D tries

This repository contains some testing and/or proof of concept projects. It's my non 'official repository' ;-)

## HelloWorldTitan
This is a basic project using TTCN-3/TITAN (see https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/f/297/).

How it works:

  1. Change to HelloWorldTitan/objs directory
  2. To build the project, run the command ```../bin/build.bash ``` to generate Makefile and binaries
  3. To execute the project, you need two terminals, located in HelloWorldTitan/objs directory:
    1. In the first one, run the command ```../bin/run_mtc.bash```
    2. In the second, run the command ```make run``` or ```make run_d``` to use GDB

Enjoy
